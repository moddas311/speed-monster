            Their main difference is that local storage data does not expire, whereas session storage data gets cleared
            when the user closes its browser window.
            Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time. So, if a user has three tabs open, each one will have
            its own page session.
            Since local storage is not session-based, all the data must be deleted via javascript or manually.
            local storage is best for storing data you want to keep long term, even after the user has closed the tab or
            browser.
            Session storage is best for storing temporary data or data that should only be accessible from one tab.

            <strong>Global Scope:</strong> The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as
            global variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part
            of that program, any function or conditional state can access that variable.
            It is not a good practice to use global variables when they are not needed as every code block will have
            access to those variables.
            <strong>Block Block Scope:</strong>Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be
            defined as the scope of the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of
            loops, or conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from
            within the curly brackets {}.
            To refer to the “status” variable, we are calling the console.log() function from outside the conditional
            brackets;

            Concepts, like passing callbacks to functions or writing asynchronous code, are often not so difficult to
            implement, which makes most JavaScript developers care less about what goes on under the hood. They just
            don't care about understanding the complexities that have deeply abstracted from them by the language.
            As a JavaScript developer, it becomes increasingly important to understand what really happens under the
            hood and how most of these complexities abstracted from us really work. It helps us make more informed
            decisions, which can, in turn, boost our code performance drastically.
            This article focuses on one of the very important but seldom understood concepts or terms in JavaScript. The
            EVENT LOOP!.
            Writing asynchronous code can not be avoided in JavaScript, but why does a code running asynchronously
            really mean? i.e. The Event Loop
            Before we can understand how the event loop works, we first have to understand what JavaScript itself is and
            how it works!

            8 Ways to get undefined
            <br>
            1. variable that is not initialized will give undefined.
            <br>
            2. function with no return.
            <br>
            3. parameter that is not passed will be undefined.
            <br>
            4. if return has nothing on the right side will return undefined.
            <br>
            5. property that doesn't exists on the object will give you undefined.
            <br>
            6. accessing array elements outside of the index range will give you undefined.
            <br>
            7. deleting an element inside an array.
            <br>
            8. set a value directly undefined.
